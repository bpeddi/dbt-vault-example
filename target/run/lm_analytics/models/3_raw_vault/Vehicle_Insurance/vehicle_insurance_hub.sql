In general, Hubs consist of 4 columns, described below.

Primary Key (src_pk)
A primary key (or surrogate key) which is usually a hashed representation of the natural key.

Natural Key / Business Key (src_nk)
This is usually a formal identification for the record, such as a incident ID. Usually called the business key because this value has meaning in business processes such as transactions and events.

Load date (src_ldts)
A load date or load date timestamp. This identifies when the record was first loaded into the database.

Record Source (src_source)
The source for the record.
